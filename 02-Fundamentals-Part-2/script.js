////////// ACTIVATING STRICT MODE
"use strict";
/* 

ðŸ’š we activated strict mode for the entire script. Now what's important is that this statement here basically has to be the very first statement in the script.

ðŸ’š So if we have any code before this, then strict mode will not be activated.

ðŸ’š We actually can also activate strict mode, only for a specific function or a specific block. But I don't really see the point in doing that.

ðŸ’š So again, first strict mode forbids us to do certain things and second it creates visible errors and the developer console, where in other situations JavaScript would just fail silently.

ðŸ’š strict mode reserves some keywords so we cannot use them for variables.
